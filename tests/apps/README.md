# XPURemoting Application Examples

## Quick Start

### build the project
in root directory
```shell
cargo build
```

### download models\[optinal\]

if you want to run inference applications, you need to download the model first. The models are

- [gpt2](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2)
- [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased)
- [stable-diffusion-v1-4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)

if you want to run ResNet application, please create a `checkpoint` folder under `tests/apps/` and run the training application first

### run applications

in root directory
```shell
NETWORK_CONFIG="path/to/config.toml" cargo run server
```

in tests/apps directory
```shell
NETWORK_CONFIG="path/to/config.toml" ./run.sh <target-python> <params>
# e.g. ./run.sh infer/gpt2/inference.py 1 4
```

information about configuratoins when running server can be found in integraton test part in [README](../../README.md)

## Correctness Test

### GPT2

remoting output: 
```
